# About
Summary
- Welcome to PokéPipeline, where all Pokémon Trainers both new and old come together to share information, chat with fellow trainers, and even schedule trades via games for the Nintendo Switch and more!

Inspiration
- Trading possibilities for nintendo players that don't have other players to trade with locally.
- A friendlier pokemon themed website to gather, trade, and share pokemon knowledge.

How to use
- You gotta like Pokemon to use!
- When searching for pokemon you MUST use all lowercase letters.
- The search feature will not work if the pokemon name is spelled wrong.
- After logging in, you must refresh the page to become logged in.
- Their is a middle-way page when you click on my page. Just click ENTER to go to your my page.
- When deleting pokemon from favorites in the editFavorites pagee, DO NOT delete your last pokemon. It causes an error.

Features
- Has separate folders for Backend and Frontend
- Languages: Javascript, SQL
- Backend: Node, Express, PostgresSQL
- FrontEnd: React, Axios 
- CyberSecurity: JWT Authentication

Bugs
- ... um. maybe...
- Brand new users have to activate a battle team and have at least one favorite pokemon in the list. Otherwise, the my page link loads forever without rendering. (Created an add a battleteam and a favorite button to combat this issue. New users must press this button before going to their my page.)
- When adding comments to chat page, user must click checkbox or else their comment won't get recorded into the database with their information attached to it. (It displays a comment with an unknown user.)
- Causes error if all pokemon are deleted from editFavorites page.

Unfinished Functionality
- Their is currently no remove comment feature. The back end was set up and works using postman, but the frontend is not connected with it.
- Users can only edit their bestpokemon. No editing username or email.

# Future Aspirations
More from the PokeAPI
- There were certain aspects of this free API that make it a little more difficult accessing specific data from it. But more time spent on this will open more doors!

More for users to do
- Users to be able to directly communicate instead of only through the chat page.
- Have users comment on another user's my page.

Possible Web Browser Game
- Users can use the battle team they created to battle CPU trainers!
